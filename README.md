# Plant-Leaf-Disease-Detection-Using-CNN-Model-and-Deep-Learing
Using Convolutional Neural Networks to identify commercial crop diseases has become a  research point in identifying plant diseases. We proposed a method to detect functional diseases using automatic image segmentation and deep learning of continuous data. An automatic image segmentation algorithm (AISA) based on the GrabCut algorithm has been developed to remove background information from the image while preserving the lesions.
